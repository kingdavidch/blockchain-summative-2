## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Functions

**Patient Functions:**
- `registerPatient()` - Self-registration
- `grantAccess()` - Give provider access
- `revokeAccess()` - Remove provider access
- `getMyInfo()` - View own information
- `getPatientRecords()` - View own records

**Provider Functions:**
- `addMedicalRecord()` - Add patient records
- `getMedicalRecord()` - View authorized records
- `accessMedicalRecord()` - Log record access

**Admin Functions:**
- `registerProvider()` - Authorize healthcare providers
- `isRegisteredProvider()` - Check provider status

**Public Functions:**
